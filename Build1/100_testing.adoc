=== Test naming conventions for Gradle

If you are using the Gradle build system, the Gradle "test" task scans all compiled classes in the source folder of the project, e.g., _/src/test/java_ or _/src/test/groovy_. 
JUnit classes are identified by:

* Class or a super class extends TestCase or GroovyTestCase
* Class or a super class is annotated with @RunWith
* Class or a super class contain a method annotated with @Test

You can set the `scanForTestClasses`
property to false, if you do not want automatic test class detection.
In this case, if no additional include /
exclude
patterns are
specified, the default for included classes are **/*Tests.class”,
“**/*Test.class” and the
default excluded
classes are
“**/Abstract*.class”.

=== Include and Exclude particular Tests

The test configuration in general is described at https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Gradle Test tasks description].

The `Test` class has a `include` and `exclude` method. 
These methods can be used to specify, which tests should actually be run.

Only run included tests:

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/test/include.gradle[]
----

Skip excluded tests:

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/test/exclude.gradle[]
----

=== Show all test output in the terminal

By default Gradle doesn't print the standard output of your tests to the terminal.
To see all output of your tests add this to your build file:

[source, groovy]
----
test {
    testLogging.showStandardStreams = true
}
----
