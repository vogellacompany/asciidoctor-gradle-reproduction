== Using the Gradle wrapper

The _Gradle wrapper_ allows that a user can run the build with a predefined version and settings of Gradle without a local Gradle installation.
This wrapper is a batch script on Windows, and a shell script for other operating systems. 
When you start a Gradle build via the wrapper, the specified version of Gradle is automatically downloaded and used to run the build.


The wrapper is the preferred way of starting a Gradle build, as it make the execution of the build independent of the installed Gradle version.
The wrapper script can be created via `gradle wrapper`.

As a result you find a _gradlew_ for *nix based systems and _gradlew.bat_ for window systems. 
These files can be used instead for the `gradle` command, and if Gradle is not installed on the machine, Gradle is automatically downloaded and installed.

It is also possible to define a task which defines the version of the wrapper. 
If this task is executed, it creates the wrapper and downloads the correct version of Gradle.


[source,gradle]
----
include::res/wrapper/wrappertask.gradle[]
----

The version of the Gradle Wrapper can also be defined, when creating it via the command line.


`gradle wrapper --gradle-version 4.9`

Without this explicit version parameter Gradle will automatically pick the latest version.


=== Configure GRADLE_OPTS for the Gradle wrapper

GRADLE_OPTS can also be defined inside the _gradlew_ or _gradlew.bat_ file.
