== Exercise: Specifying a custom Task in another gradle file

Create a new Gradle project, which contains the following structure.

image::buildSrc_Tasks.png[]
	

The _CheckWebsite.groovy_ class looks like this:

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/CheckWebsite.groovy[]
----


Since this class has external dependencies to jsoup, a _build.gradle_ file for this class has to be created.

So the _build.gradle_ inside the _buildSrc_ folder, which is responsible for building the `CheckWebsite` class, looks like this:

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/buildSrcCheckWebsite.gradle[]
----

Finally the main _build.gradle_ file in the root folder makes use of the new `com.example.CheckWebsite` task type.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/Checkwebsite.gradle[]
----
