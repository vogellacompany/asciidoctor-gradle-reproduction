== Exercise - Create Custom Gradle Tasks

=== Exercise - Hello Gradle Task

Create a _helloGradle_ task, which prints _Hello Gradle_ with the group _workshop_ and a proper description.

Then use the `./gradlew tasks` command to see your new _helloGradle_ task in the console or use Buildship in the Eclipse IDE.

Then invoke the _helloGradle_ task by calling `./gradlew hG` or again use Buildship in the Eclipse IDE.

=== Exercise - Dependencies between tasks

Create two new tasks called `learnGroovy`, which prints _Learn Groovy_,  and `learnGradle`, which prints 'Learn Gradle'.

These tasks should have reasonable dependencies.

=== Exercise - doFirst action for the tasks

Extend the `learnGroovy` task so that it prints _Install Eclipse IDE with Buildship_ before it prints Learn Groovy.
