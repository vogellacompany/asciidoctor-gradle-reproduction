=== Creating a multi project build structure

A business application usually does not consist of only one single project/module, but has many projects, which should be build.

Gradle has the concept of a root project, which can have many sub projects. 
The root project is specified by a _build.gradle_ file, like the single projects before. 
To specify, which projects belong to the build a _settings.gradle_ file is used.

For instance there might be this project structure:

* root_project
** core
** ui
** util
* settings.gradle

Having this project structure the _settings.gradle_ file would look like this:

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/multiproject/simple_settings.gradle[]
----


Besides the `tasks` task Gradle also provides a `projects` help task, which can be run in the _root_project_ folder.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/multiproject/projects_task.cmdline[]
----

=== Specifying a general build configuration

In a _build.gradle_ file in the root_project general configurations can be applied to all projects or just to the sub projects.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/multiproject/root_build.gradle[]
----

This specifies a common `com.example.gradle` group and the `0.1.0` version to all projects.

The `subprojects` closure applies common configurations for all sub projects, but not to the root project, like the `allprojects` closure does.
	
=== Project specific configurations and dependencies

The `core`, `ui` and `util` sub projects can also have their own _build.gradle_ file.
If they have specific needs, which are not already applied by the general configuration of the root project.

For instance the ui project usually has a dependency to the core project. 
So the ui project needs its own build.gradle file to specify this dependency.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res//multiproject/ui_build.gradle[]
----

Project dependencies are specified with the project method.

[NOTE]
====
The `':'` before the core project reference is Gradle specific and acts pretty much like a slash (`'/'`), when referencing a folder structure.
====

Alternatively you can also define the dependencies of a project in the root build.gradle file. 
But it is considered good practice to define the dependencies in the project specific build.gradle files, hence the following approach is only included for demonstration purpose.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/multiproject/ui_build_master.gradle[]
