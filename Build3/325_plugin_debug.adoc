== Debugging Gradle Plug-ins

=== Activate remote debugging

The following properties have to be specified in the _gradle.properties_ file to enable remote debugging:

[source, properties]
----
org.gradle.daemon=true
org.gradle.jvmargs=-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Xmx4g -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5006
----

When running a Gradle build locally with these settings remote debugging can be accessed via localhost on port 5006.

[TIP]
====
The _gradle.properties_ file is usually located in the gradleHomeDir (usually _/${user.home}/.gradle_)
====

=== Remote debugging in the Eclipse IDE

You should import a certain Gradle plug-in into the Eclipse IDE by using the Buildship tooling.

Then break points can be added to the Gradle plug-in's source files.

After that open the debug configuration and right click _Remote Java Application_ to create a _New_ _Debug Configuration_ with the follwing settings:

Press the kbd:[Debug] button to run the remote debugger.

Then a Gradle build, which uses the desired Gradle plug-in, can be run by either using the Gradle Tasks View of the Buildship tooling inside the Eclipse IDE or invoke a Gradle build from command line. 

When a break point is hit during the Gradle task processing the Eclipse IDE will stop at that point.
