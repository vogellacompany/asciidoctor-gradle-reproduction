== Optional Exercise - Publishing the plug-in to the Gradle plug-in portal

To publish a Gradle plug-in in the Gradle Plug-in Portal the _com.gradle.plugin-publish_ Gradle plug-in can be used.

Before uploading Gradle plug-ins to the portal you must register at https://plugins.gradle.org/user/register and obtain the api keys from your profile.

The _gradle.publish.key_ and _gradle.publish.secret_ properties have to be added to the _gradle.properties_.

[TIP]
====
The _gradle.properties_ file is usually located in the gradleHomeDir (usually _/${user.home}/.gradle_)
====

Then the _build.gradle_ file needs to be adjusted to be able to upload Gradle plug-ins.


[source, groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'java-gradle-plugin'
    id 'maven-publish'
    id 'com.gradle.plugin-publish' version '0.9.10' 
}

// more code ...

pluginBundle {
    website = '${Web site for your plugin}'
    vcsUrl = 'https://github.com/${your-repo}'

    plugins {
        vogellaPlugin {
            id = 'com.vogella.gradleplugin'
            displayName = 'Vogella Sample Plug-in'
            description = 'Vogella Sample Plug-in for trying the '
            tags = ['Vogella','Training','Gradle','Sample']
            // Gradle's plug-in portal does not support SNAPSHOTs
            version = '0.0.1'
        }
    }
}
----

The following task can then be used to upload the Gradle plug-in.

[source, console]
----
./gradlew publishPlugins
----

When the plug-in has been published the _plugins_ closure can be used to make use of the Gradle plug-in.

[source, groovy]
----
plugins {
  id "com.vogella.gradleplugin" version "0.0.1"
}
----

So the more verbose `buildscript` closure and the `apply plugin` method from previous chapters can be omitted.
