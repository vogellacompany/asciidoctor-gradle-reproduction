== Gradle Tasks

=== Default Gradle tasks
		
Gradle also offers tasks for introspection of Gradle itself, so a Gradle project can be analyzed by using Gradle's default tasks.
		
		
A good example is the `tasks` task, which shows the available tasks of a project.
When typing `gradle -q tasks`, a list of tasks is shown. 
This command lists the base tasks even without an `build.gradle` file.

Gradle also tries to give some guidance for the usage of invoked tasks, as shown in the bottom of the console output.
The `gradle tasks --all` command would also list dependent tasks, which are invoked before the actual task.
		
		
When running `gradle tasks --all` the output looks quite similar to the one before, except of the `init` task, which depends on the `wrapper` task.

=== Creating custom Gradle tasks
		
In the <<gradle_runbuild_buildfile>> section the first minimalist task in a `build.gradle` file has been created.
		
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/starter/build_hello.gradle[]
----
		
		
When running the `gradle -q tasks` task with this `build.gradle` file, the `hello` task will be listed under "Other tasks".

Tasks without a group are considered as private tasks.
For instance, the _Gradle Task View_ of the Eclipse Gradle Plug-in does not show such tasks.
But they can be shown by activating the right entry in the view's menu.
		
		
Groups can be applied with the `group` property and a description can be applied by using the `description` property. 
In case the group already exists the `hello` task is added to it. If the group does not exist, it is created.
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/build_hello_described.gradle[]
----
		
	
[[gradle_task_structure]]
=== Task structure
		
Gradle has different phases, when working with tasks. 
First of all there is a configuration phase, where the code, which is specified directly in a task's closure, is executed. 
The configuration block is executed for every available task and not only for those tasks, which are later actually executed.
		
		
After the configuration phase, the execution phase then runs the code inside the `doFirst` or `doLast` closures of those tasks, which are actually executed.
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/configuration_phase_build.gradle[]
----
		
		
When running `gradle -q anotherUnrelatedTask` the following is printed:

[source,console]
----
I always get printed even though, I am not invoked
I am in the doLast execution phase
----

The first statement comes from the configuration phase in which the task definition of the `onlySpecifiesCodeForConfigurationPhase` is evaluated.

[[gradle_task_dependencies]]
=== Task dependencies

Gradle allows the definition of default tasks in the build file. 
These are executed, if no other tasks are specified.
Tasks can also define their dependencies. 
Both settings are demonstrated in the following build file.
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res//starter/build.gradle[]
----
		
Hooking into predefined task executions for default tasks or tasks from plug-ins can also be done by using the `dependsOn` method.
		
For instance when certain things have to be done right after the compilation of java code:
		
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/compile_java_dep_build.gradle[]
----
		
		
An alternative to creating a new task, which depends on the
`'compileJava'`
task, a new execution block can also be directly applied to an
existing
task, e.g., the
`'compileJava'`
task.
		
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/add_action_to_existing_task_build.gradle[]
----
		
When running the javaCompile task all actions, which have been
applied to the javaCompile task, are run one by
one according to the
order they have been applied to the task.
		
	

[[skip_gradle_tasks]]
=== Skipping Tasks
		
Skipping tasks can be done by passing a predicate closure to the `onlyIf` method of a task or by throwing a `StopExecutionException`. 
		

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/skip_tasks_build.gradle[]
----
		
		
NOTE: Tasks depending on the eclipse task will be run even, if a  `StopExecutionException` is thrown.
	
==== Accessing system variables like the user home directory

You can access system variables.
For example, to get the user home directory use the following:

[source,gradle]
----
def homePath = System.properties['user.home']
----
