== Exercise: Creating a Copy Task

New tasks can also be created and derived from another task and specify certain properties.

The `Copy` task type can be used to specify such a task, which is able to copy files.

Create a new project with the following _build.gradle_ file:

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/copy_task_type.gradle[]
----

Create a _source_ folder inside this project and add a text file to this folder.

When running the `copyFile` task it copies the text file to a new _destination_ folder.
