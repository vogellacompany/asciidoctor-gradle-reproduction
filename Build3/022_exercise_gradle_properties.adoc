== Exercise: Configure Gradle properties

When using the _gradle_ command the first time a _.gradle_ folder is created in the ${USER_HOME} directory.

On Linux this is usually /home/${yourUserName}/.gradle

On Windows this is usually C:\Users\${yourUserName}\.gradle

On Mac this is usually /Users/${yourUserName}/.gradle

Inside this _.gradle_ folder a _gradle.properties_ file with the following contents has to be created.

[source, properties]
----
org.gradle.warning.mode=all
----

Now the default of the _org.gradle.warning.mode_ property will be overridden. (Default is summary)

NOTE: Common or secret properties can be set or overridden here, e.g., Gradle defaults or access tokens for deployment.
