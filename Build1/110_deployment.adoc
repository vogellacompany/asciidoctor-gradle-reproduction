=== Using the maven-publish plugin
		
The most common way is to use the `maven-publish` plugin, which is provides by Gradle by default.
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/deployment/maven_plugin_local.gradle[]
----
		
		
There are several publish options, when the `java` and the `maven-publish` plugin is applied.
