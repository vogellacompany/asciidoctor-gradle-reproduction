== Developing custom Gradle plug-ins

=== Why creating Gradle plug-ins

As a general rule, it is useful to have a build that is as much declarative as possible as this simplifies future maintenance. 
Therefore it is advised to avoid complex code in your Gradle build file. 
If you need custom logic you should place it into a custom Gradle plug-in.

=== Gradle DSL 

Each Gradle plug-in comes with a DSL. 
To see all properties of a Gradle object, you can use the following code snippet:

[source,code]
----
println variants.properties
            .sort{it.key}
            .collect{it}
            .findAll{!filtered.contains(it.key)}
            .join('\n')
----

For example to define a tasks which show the properties of all `android.applicationVariants` (in an Android project), use:

[source,code]
----
task showAndoidVariantsInformation {
    doLast {
        android.applicationVariants.all { variants ->
        	println variants.properties
            .sort{it.key}
            .collect{it}
            .findAll{!filtered.contains(it.key)}
            .join('\n')
        }
    }
}
