== Building Java projects
=== The Java plug-in
		
The Java plug-in provides tasks to compile Java source code, run unit tests, create Javadoc and create a JAR file.
	
=== Default project layout of Java projects
		
This plug-ins assume a certain setup of your Java project (similar to Maven).

* src/main/java contains the Java source code
* src/test/java contains the Java tests
	
If you follow this setup, the following build file is sufficient to compile, test and bundle a Java project.
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/java/build.gradle[]
----
		
To start the build, type `gradle build` on the command line.
		
`SourceSets` can be used to specify a different project structure, e.g., the sources are stored in a _src_ folder rather than in _src/main/java_.

=== Java project creation with the init task
		
Gradle does not yet support multiple project templates (called archetypes) like Maven. 
But it offers an `init` task to create the structure of a new Gradle project. 
Without additional parameters, this task creates a Gradle project, which contains the gradle wrapper files, a _build.gradle_ and _settings.gradle_ file.
		
When adding the `--type` parameter with `'java-library'` as value, a java project structure is created and the _build.gradle_ file contains a certain Java template with JUnit.

The _build.gradle_ file will look similar to this:
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/java/build_init_java.gradle[]
----
		
A project hosted at Github https://github.com/townsfolk/gradle-templates[Gradle-templates project] provides more templates beyond the init task. 
The Gradle team is also working on this archetype/template topic.
		
=== Specifying the Java version in your build file
		
Usually a Java project has a version and a target JRE on which it is compiled.
The `version` and `sourceCompatibility` property can be set in the _build.gradle_ file.
		
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/java/build_version_sourceComp.gradle[]
----
		
When the `version` property is set, the name of the resulting artifact will be changed accordingly, e.g., _{my-lib-name}-0.1.0.jar_.
		
If the artifact is an executable java application the _MANIFEST.MF_ file must be aware of the class with the main method.
