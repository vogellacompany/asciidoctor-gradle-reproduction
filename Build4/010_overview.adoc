== Introduction to the Gradle build system

=== What is the Gradle build system?

(((Gradle)))
_Gradle_ is an advanced general purpose build management system based on Groovy and Kotlin.
Gradle supports the automatic download and configuration of dependencies or other libraries. 
It supports Maven and Ivy repositories for retrieving these dependencies. 
This allows reusing the artifacts of existing build systems.

Gradle supports multi-project and multi-artifact builds.

Gradle has the notion of _projects_ and _tasks_.


[[gradle_projectstasks]]
=== Projects and tasks in Gradle

A Gradle build consists of one or more _projects_.
Projects can be something which should be built or something that should be done. 
Each project consists of _tasks_. 
A task represents a piece of work which a build performs, e.g., compile the source code or generate the Javadoc.

=== The Gradle build file - build.gradle

A project using Gradle describes its build via a _build.gradle_ file. 
This file is located in the root folder of the project.
The build file for Gradle builds is based on a _Domain Specific Language_ (DSL). 
In this file you can use a combination of declarative and imperative statements.
You can also write Groovy or Kotlin code, whenever you need it. 
Tasks can also be created and extended dynamically at runtime.


This build file defines a project and its tasks. 
Gradle is a general purpose build system hence this build file can perform any task. 
The following listing represents a very simple build file.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/starter/build_hello.gradle[]
----

[NOTE]
====
In older Gradle files you might encounter the use of `<<` instead of `doLast`.

[source, groovy]
----
include::res/starter/build_hello_deprecated.gradle[]
----

This option is removed in Gradle v5.0.
====


To execute the `hello` task in this build file, type `gradle hello` on the command line in the directory of the build file. 
If the Gradle output should be suppressed, use the `-q` (quiet) parameter.

[source,console]
----
include::res/starter/runbuild.gradle[]
----

[[gradle_runbuild_buildfile_comments]]

=== Comments in Gradle build files
You can use single and multiline comments in Gradle build files.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/comments/example.gradle[]
----

=== Project settings and description

By default, Gradle uses the directory name as project name. 
You can change this by creating a _settings.gradle_ file in the directory which specifies the project name.


[source,console]
----
include::res/settings/settings.gradle[]
----

You can also add a description to your project via the _build.gradle_ file.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/settings/build.gradle[]
----

Use the `gradle project` command to get information about your project. 
The following listing shows the output.

[source,console]
----
include::res/settings/settings.output[]
----


== Gradle plug-ins

(((Gradle, Plug-ins)))
The Gradle build system uses plug-ins to extend its core functionality.
A plug-in is an extension to Gradle which typically adds some preconfigured tasks.
Gradle ships with a number of plug-ins, and you can develop custom plug-ins.
	
One example is the Java plug-in.
This plug-in adds tasks to your project which allow compiling Java source code, run unit tests and to create a JAR file.
	
A plug-in is included in a _build.gradle_ file with the `apply plugin: 'pluginname'` statement.
	
For example the entry `apply plugin: 'com.android.application'` makes the Android plug-in available for a Gradle build.
	
Gradle provides also a registry for plug-ins via http://plugins.gradle.org[Gradle Plugin search].
