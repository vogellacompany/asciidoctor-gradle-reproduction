== Convert Maven Projects to Gradle
	
Gradle provides an incubating init task, which helps with the creation of new Gradle projects. 
This task can also convert Apache Maven _pom.xml_ files to Gradle build files, if all used Maven plug-ins are known to this task.
	
	
In this section the following _pom.xml_ maven configuration will be converted to a Gradle project.
	
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/maven/gradle-convert-pom.xml[]

Running the `gradle init --type pom` command on the command line results in the following Gradle configuration.

The init task depends on the wrapper task so that also a Gradle wrapper is created.
	
	
The resulting _build.gradle_ file looks similar to this:
	
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/maven/build.gradle[]
